			<p>The Technology Radar captures the output of these discussions in a format that provides value to a wide range of stakeholders, from CIOs to enterprise developers. The content provided in this document is kept at a summary level, leaving it up to the reader to pursue more detailed knowledge when needed.
			The goal of the radar is conciseness, so that its target audience understands it quickly. The radar is graphical in nature, grouping items into techniques, tools, languages and platforms. Some radar items could appear in multiple quadrants, but we mapped them to the quadrant that seemed most appropriate. We further group these items in four rings to reflect our current position on them. The rings are
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Hold</strong>: Proceed with caution.</li>
				<li><strong>Assess</strong>: Worth exploring with the goal of understanding how it will affect your enterprise.</li>
				<li><strong>Trial</strong>: Worth pursuing. It is important to understand how to build up this capability. Enterprises should try this technology on a project that can handle the risk.</li>
				<li><strong>Adopt</strong>: Industry has finished trial and found proper patterns of usage, or we feel strongly that the industry should be adopting it now, rather than going through a gradual adoption.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As we look at each quadrant in detail, we show the movement that each item has taken since the last publication of the radar. New items are represented as triangles, while items that were on the last radar are represented as circles. Items that have not moved in two publications of the radar fade and are no longer displayed unless something significant happens.
